# minesweeper
Learning Git and GitHub commands.

Throughout this project I have learned:
- Basic OOP
- Basic logic
- Basic Python
- Debugging
- Python list copying and mutable variables

The game itself isn't pleasant as it doesn't have any graphical interface. Writing the code was the point for this project.
